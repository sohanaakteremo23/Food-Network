            About Me
            </h1>
            <p>My name is Ms. Eto and I am the creator of this website. I have a strong passion for food made by hand using
            traditional methods from high quality ingredients. I have been making my own breads, sausages, cheeses, beer, ciders and
            other artisan foods for nearly two decades now. It may come as a surprise but making these foods at home is not that
            difficult. It certainly is a lot simpler than most people think.</p><br><br>

            <h1>Juicy Beef Stick Recipe</h1>
            <p>These beef sticks are made with either thin sheep casings, or with 18-22 mm edible collagen casings. I tend to use
            collagen casings to make beef sticks 90% of the time.</p>
